# 📘 DSA Problems Practice by Manish Kumar Singh

This repository contains my personal notes, code solutions, and dry runs of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems. It includes problems from platforms like **LeetCode, CodeStudio, GeeksforGeeks, and more.**

## 🧠 What's Inside?

✅ DSA Basics (Arrays, Strings, Stack, Queue, etc.)  
✅ Problem-solving with step-wise dry run  
✅ Optimized solutions with comments  
✅ Notes for quick revision  
✅ Code in Python (and more coming...)
